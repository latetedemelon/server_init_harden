# Linux Server Hardener

A robust POSIX-compliant shell script that automates security hardening for Linux systems through SSH hardening, intrusion detection, firewall configuration, and granular access controls. This production-grade solution ensures consistent security baselines while maintaining compatibility across major Linux distributions.

## **WARNING**

This script can potentially make your server inaccessible if not used properly. Make sure you:

-   Have a backup access method
-   Review the script before running
-   Keep the terminal session open until completion
-   Save all credentials shown/logged during execution

### IMPORTANT: SSH Key Management

After running the script, you MUST:

1. **Save the SSH Private Key**

    - Copy the entire private key content (starts with `-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----`)
    - Store it securely on your local machine as `id_ed25519` or similar
    - Keep it strictly private and NEVER share it with anyone
    - Without this key, you cannot access your server

2. **Save the Key Passphrase**

    - Store the generated passphrase securely
    - Required every time you use the private key
    - Keep it secret like a password
    - Cannot be recovered if lost

3. **Public Key (Optional Save)**
    - The part ending in `.pub` (starts with `ssh-ed25519`)
    - Already configured on the server
    - Can be shared safely with others
    - Used for adding access to other servers

Without the private key and passphrase, you will permanently lose access to your server!

## Status

Tested and working on:

-   Debian 11, 12
-   Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04, 24.10

-   **Clear Warnings**: Improved warning messages and precautions

### OS Support üêß

-   Removed unnecessary OS Restrictions

-   Tested on the following distributions:
    -   Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04, 24.10
    -   Debian 11, 12
    -   Fedora 40, 41 (in testing)
    -   FreeBSD (in future)

### Test with Docker üê≥

-   **Test Commands**: Added various test scenarios
-   **Multi-distro**: Support for testing across distributions
-   **Quick Testing**: Faster feedback loop for testing changes

## Usage

### Requirements

-   Root/sudo privileges
-   One of the supported Linux distributions:
    -   Debian 11/12
    -   Ubuntu 20.04/22.04/24.04
    -   Fedora 40/41

### Options

-   `-u USERNAME`: Create a new sudo user
-   `-r`: Reset root password to secure random value
-   `-s`: Show sensitive information in console output
-   `-h`: Display help message

```bash
# Basic hardening (SSH, Fail2ban, UFW, create & secure SSH key for logged in user)
# Default behavior - no user creation, no root reset, no show credentials info
# Use it when VPS already disabled root password and created new user during setup (e.g. NetCup)
./init-linux-harden.sh

# Create new sudo user during hardening
# Use it when VPS already disabled root password, but no new user created
./init-linux-harden.sh -u jay

# Create new user and reset root password
./init-linux-harden.sh -u jay -r

# Show all credentials in console output (less secure)
./init-linux-harden.sh -u jay -s
```

### Post Installation

-   Check if the services are working properly

```bash
sudo ufw status

sudo fail2ban-client status
```

## Features

The script performs comprehensive security hardening:

### SSH Hardening

-   Uses Ed25519 SSH keys (stronger than RSA)
-   Disables root login
-   Disables password authentication
-   Enforces public key authentication
-   Creates backup of original config
-   Secures authorized_keys file with proper permissions

### Fail2ban Protection

-   Protects against brute force attempts
-   Configures SSH jail (1 day ban time)
-   Configures recidive jail (30 days for repeat offenders)
-   Configures nginx-http-auth jail
-   Auto-excludes server's public IP
-   TIP: Unban using `fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip <IP>`

### UFW Firewall

-   Enables and configures UFW
-   Allows SSH (22), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443)
-   Blocks all other incoming traffic
-   Allows all outgoing traffic
-   TIP: Add new rules with `ufw allow <service>`

### User Management

-   Option to reset root password
-   Creates new sudo user (optional)
-   Generates secure random password
-   Creates Ed25519 SSH key pair with 1000 KDF rounds
-   Configures authorized_keys securely
-   TIP: Copy the user credentials from the log file after the script completes

### Backup and Recovery

-   Creates backups of all modified configuration files
-   Automatic recovery if operations fail
-   Restarts affected services as needed
-   Detailed logging for troubleshooting

### Logging

-   All operations logged to `./${SCRIPT_NAME}_TIMESTAMP.log`
-   Sensitive information only logged to file by default
-   Optional console display with `-s` flag
-   Execution time tracking
-   Separate console/file logging levels

## To-do

-   [ ] Test on Fedora 40, 41 on VPS and not on Docker (it fails on Docker right now)
-   [ ] Test on FreeBSD
